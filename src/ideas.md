# Our Garden

# Website ideas
1. Instrad of notebook themed, it can be Shosh's treasure chest box. The first screen you see if you are not signed in is the closed box and the cat that you can move around to open the box. When you click open, it takes you to the connect spotify screen. Then, you are inside the box and there are songs all around it. Idk how they should be styled yet. 


1. Let either of us upload a doodle and add it to our garden
2. Let us move the songs around the garden. We could each have a character that we can move around the garden and discover songs. 
3. We can hide things in the garden for eachother. 
4. This could keep evolving, I can start with a garden, then add a house and a whole new world for us to explore and share together.


# Features to add
1. When one song finishes, play the next one instead of repeating the same song! 

# Trinkets to add
1. Lobster toy
2. Cat doing a pullup
3. Cat laying on person's leg
4. Eating salt 
5. Trophy case on the wall with framed gold medal



# IDE ideas
1. I want to have a main agent (for the project) with a bunch of tasks. I think of this entire thing as one project. So I frequently notice myself starting a new taskpane when I finish a task (which I think is good practice that we want to encourage people to do), and then when I go back to the new taskpane, I want to say something like "Okay, now I want to do X". I want to kind of know where I am in the project and what I have already accomplished and where I want to go.

We could do the following for our vibe-coding mode: 
1. You can either display in IDE mode or agent mode. 
2. In IDE mode it is left as is
3. In agent mode, you get a split view of the chat taskpane and the rendered outputs. That is all. 
4. When you click on a chat taskpane code cell, it takes you to the code (swapping out the output only view)
5. When you right click on something in the output only notebook, it takes you to that same location in the IDE.

# Our Garden

# Website ideas
1. Let either of us upload a doodle and add it to our garden
2. Let us move the songs around the garden. We could each have a character that we can move around the garden and discover songs. 
3. We can hide things in the garden for eachother. 
4. This could keep evolving, I can start with a garden, then add a house and a whole new world for us to explore and share together. 


# Trinkets to add
1. Lobster toy
2. Cat doing a pullup
3. Cat laying on person's leg



# IDE ideas
1. I want to have a main agent (for the project) with a bunch of tasks. I think of this entire thing as one project. So I frequently notice myself starting a new taskpane when I finish a task (which I think is good practice that we want to encourage people to do), and then when I go back to the new taskpane, I want to say something like "Okay, now I want to do X". I want to kind of know where I am in the project and what I have already accomplished and where I want to go.

We could do the following for our notebook only mode: 
1. You can either display in IDE mode or agent mode. 
2. In IDE mode it is left as is
3. In agent mode, you get a split view of the chat taskpane and the rendered outputs. That is all. 
4. When you click on a chat taskpane code cell, it takes you to the code (swapping out the output only view)
5. When you right click on something in the output only notebook, it takes you to that same location in the IDE.
